# My First Android Application

## The Cheese Clicker 

### To-Dos:
* Add a feature that sets a timer for the user. They have to click the cheese as many times as poss before time's up.
* Background image
* Make the game object-orientated. Poss objects: the cheese, the score text view 

### Questions for Codebar/ More to Explore:
* How do I make the colour of the score displayed flash up a different colour when the user reaches a multiple of ten points?
* How do I make a welcome screen that they start with and can go back to when they've finished playing?
* How do I make a widget/icon for the app in user's application menu?
* How do I let the users log in, put scores on a leaderboard etc?
